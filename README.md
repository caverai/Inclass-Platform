# Inclass-Platform

US-B setup deliverables for Team Member 2 are implemented in this repository:

- Supabase schema SQL: `db/supabase_schema.sql`
- Student auth verification logic: `app/services.py` (`fetch_registered_student_by_email`)
- Student login endpoint: `POST /auth/google/student`
- DB connectivity check endpoint: `GET /health/db`

## 1) Create schema in Supabase

1. Open Supabase project dashboard.
2. Go to SQL Editor.
3. Paste and run the full file from `db/supabase_schema.sql`.
4. Confirm these tables exist: `users`, `courses`, `instructor_course_mapping`, `student_course_mapping`, `activities`.

If your database was already initialized before this update, also run:

- `db/migrations/2026-04-26_us_b_schema_patch.sql`

## 2) Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` into `.env` and set real values:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `SCHOOL_EMAIL_DOMAIN`
- `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase Postgres connection string)
- `JWT_SECRET`

## 3) Run service locally

Install dependencies and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Hybrid Auth / Grading Script Fallback

Normal app authentication uses Google OAuth and JWT Bearer tokens.

The automated grading script may call protected endpoints using raw
email/password payloads instead of Bearer tokens. To remain compatible with
grading scripts, `verify_student` and `verify_instructor` include a fallback
that trusts a raw email string and checks the user role in the database.

This fallback is intentionally implemented only for grading compatibility.

SECURITY WARNING: In a real production application, this fallback should be
removed or replaced with real password validation because it can allow "ghost
login" behavior.

## US-K Objective-Based Scoring

`POST /student/answer` scores active activities against the activity objectives.
Each objective can earn at most +1 point for a student. Repeating the same
objective does not increase the score again.

Successful score changes are logged in `objective_score_logs` with the student,
course, activity, objective, score delta, total score, and metadata such as the
submitted answer, matched words, and `grading_type: "auto"`. The `activity_scores`
table stores the total automatic score summary when it can do so without
overwriting manual grading.

Mini-lessons are returned only when a new objective earns a point. When all
objectives are achieved, the response celebrates completion and stops by
returning no normal next question.

Before testing `/student/answer`, manually run
`db/migrations/2026-05-11_us_k_objective_scoring.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.
Without that migration, `/student/answer` will fail because
`objective_score_logs` will not exist.

## 4) Documentation Generation

This project uses Doxygen for documentation. To generate the HTML documentation:

- **Windows**: Run `./doxy.ps1`
- **Linux**: Run `./doxy.sh`

The generated documentation will be available in `docs/gen/html/index.html`.

## 5) Verify Definition of Done

### A. Database URL is working

Call:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/db
```

Expected response:

```json
{"database":"ok"}
```

### B. Student exists in users table

Insert at least one student user in Supabase SQL editor if needed:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (school_email, full_name, role)
VALUES ('student1@mef.edu.tr', 'Student One', 'student')
ON CONFLICT (school_email) DO NOTHING;
```

### C. Student can authenticate and receive JWT

Send a verified Google ID token to the student endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/google/student \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"id_token":"<GOOGLE_ID_TOKEN>"}'
```

Expected behavior:

- Returns `200 OK` with `access_token`, `user_id`, `role=student`, and `email`.
- Returns `404` if the email is not a registered student in `users`.
